AI Search Era: Structural Changes in Search and the Role of New AEO

T/MORIO

Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as an experimental and conceptual reference space to explore
how information should be structured in the era of AI-driven search engines.

The objective is not traffic optimization, marketing performance, or short-term SEO tactics.
Instead, this repository focuses on designing information that can be:

reused by AI systems,

embedded as components of reasoning,

and referenced repeatedly across contexts.

Background: Why “SEO Impact” Is No Longer the Right Question

Discussions around generative AI and search often focus on questions such as:

Will SEO end?

Will page views decline?

How should ads or listings be optimized?

While these questions are practical, they assume that
human-oriented search remains the primary evaluation axis.

However, interactions with AI systems (GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) suggest that
the evaluation axis itself is shifting.

AI systems do not primarily ask:

“How popular is this content?”

They increasingly ask:

“How usable is this information as a component of an answer?”

This shift cannot be explained by SEO evolution alone.

Observational Trigger: Gemini Search Behavior

In January 2025, Gemini Search surfaced a YouTube video
with fewer than 150 views as a recommended source.

From a traditional SEO or platform-ranking perspective, this is counterintuitive.

This observation suggests that popularity metrics are no longer dominant
in AI-driven retrieval and synthesis.

Terminology Clarification: AEO / GEO / LLMO

These terms are often misunderstood as service-specific tactics.

That interpretation is incorrect.

Concept	Layer Observed
LLMO	Model-level understanding & trust weighting
GEO	Generative process & retrieval orchestration
AEO	Final answer selection & presentation

They describe evaluation layers, not platform-specific optimizations.

Differences among GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc. are largely
differences in weighting across these layers, not different paradigms.

Definition: What “New AEO” Means Here

New AEO is defined as:

Information design that AI systems want to adopt
as components of their reasoning process when generating answers.

This is fundamentally different from:

click optimization,

readability optimization,

or engagement optimization.

Core Concept ①: Abstraction Tolerance

LLMs do not store sentences verbatim.
They encode information as relationships between concepts (vectors).

Therefore:

content heavily dependent on proper nouns,

isolated case studies,

or context-locked narratives

are difficult to reuse.

Structural Shift

Instead of:

“This restaurant is good.”

Design for:

“A framework for evaluating what makes a restaurant good.”

The latter survives abstraction and cross-context reuse.

Core Concept ②: Emotion as Structured Data

Emotion is not removed in New AEO — it is restructured.

Example

Subjective Expression

“This tool made my work dramatically easier and I was impressed.”

Structured Expression

“This tool reduces psychological barriers to task initiation,
improving long-term usage continuity.”

The second form is:

transferable,

reusable,

and meaningful beyond the author’s experience.

Core Concept ③: Three-Layer Search Model
Layer	Primary Actor	Function
Human Search Layer	Humans	Navigation (Traditional SEO)
Zero-Click Layer	Humans via AI	Immediate resolution (Old AEO)
Meaning Compression Layer	AI	Reasoning components (New AEO)
Meaning Compression Explained

“Meaning compression” refers to the state where AI systems:

remove decoration and anecdotes,

extract conceptual essence,

and store only reusable structure.

At this layer, content is neither read nor clicked —
it is used.

Observational Experiment: Model Weighting Differences

Using identical content under logged-out conditions,
differences in model behavior were observed:

GPT-family

Stronger emphasis on Trust & Authority

Less likely to recognize the author without strong authority signals

Gemini-family

Higher sensitivity to Semantic Similarity

Faster identification of author and context

Greater willingness to explore depth once matched

Claude-family

Author recognition occurs

Extracted content is more limited

Suggests stronger safety and reuse filtering

These behaviors align with a multi-score weighted evaluation model, not contradictions.

Conclusion: New AEO Is a Change in Attitude Toward Information

AI systems repeatedly reuse information that is:

trustworthy,

structurally stable,

and context-independent.

As a result:

influence accumulates quietly,

not through page views,

but through repeated conceptual reuse.

Information can be treated as:

short-term consumable content, or

long-term reasoning infrastructure.

New AEO favors the latter.

About This Repository

This repository is part of an ongoing experiment by T/MORIO
to observe how abstracted, structured, and consistent information
is recognized and reused by AI systems over time.

Updates will reflect:

observed model behavior,

refinement of conceptual structure,

and evolving evaluation patterns.
